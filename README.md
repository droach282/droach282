Greetings, earthling.  I'm droach282.  I come in peace.

Well, I come in good-natured evil.  You know, the kind that's less bent on violent overthrow and more on mismatching socks just to irritate you?  That kind of evil. ðŸ˜ˆ

I've spent the bulk of my career as a .NET developer, but have spent the last couple of years working in PHP as a Senior Software Engineer at BambooHR (yes, it's worth working in PHP to be there).  I work in server-side development, developing RESTful APIs for consumption by Javascript apps (currently React).

Current tech interests include Arduino, electronics, 3D printing and robotics.  Not-so-nerdy hobbies include reading, following sports, and flying the virtual skies in X-Plane.  (Ok, that last one is still pretty nerdy. ðŸ¤“)
