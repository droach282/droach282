Greetings, earthling.  I'm droach282.  I come in peace.

Well, I come in good-natured evil.  You know, the kind that's less bent on violent overthrow and more on mismatching socks just to irritate you?  That kind of evil. ðŸ˜ˆ

I've spent the bulk of my career as a .NET developer.  I'm currently employed at Applied Systems as a Sr. Software Engineer.

Current tech interests include Arduino, electronics, 3D printing, robotics, and homelabbing.  Not-so-nerdy hobbies include reading and following sports.
